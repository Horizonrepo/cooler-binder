# `cooler` tutorial

Try out `cooler` with a brief interactive tutorial by clicking this here button --> [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/mirnylab/cooler-binder)

It will launch a "Binder" application using the code in this repository.

To start, after launching the binder, simply click on  **cooler_quickstart.ipynb** IPython notebook. 

To run the code in a cell, press `shift+enter`. Individual cells can then be modified and re-run. To flush the current set of variables, restart the notebook kernel from the Kernel menu.

If you are experiencing delays, please check the Binder [system status](http://mybinder.org/status).

This walkthrough was built using open source [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) and [Binder](http://mybinder.org/). If you're interested, you can watch (or skim through) this 30-min video tutorial on Jupyter Notebooks:
