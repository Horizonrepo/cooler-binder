It will launch a "Binder" application using the code in this repository.

If you are experiencing delays, please check the Binder <a href="http://mybinder.org/status" target="_blank">system status</a>. The service may be down.

To start, after launching the binder, simply click on one of the IPython Notebook files:

- **cooler_cli.ipynb** for a walkthrough of the command line interface.
- **cooler_api.ipynb** for a walkthrough of the Python API.

To run the code in a cell, press `shift+enter`. Individual cells can then be modified and re-run. To flush the current set of variables, restart the notebook kernel from the Kernel menu.

This walkthrough was built using open source [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) and [Binder](http://mybinder.org/) projects.
